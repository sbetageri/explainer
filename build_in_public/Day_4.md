# Day 4

Progress made so far : 
- Built a web browsing agent using AWS Strands
  - Experimented with using custom playwright based browsing
  - Default browser from strands was sufficient
- Built a pipeline to extract URLs, HTML and Markdown from the website
- The above process is proving to be quite expensive. Costing around $2 for 4 webpages.
